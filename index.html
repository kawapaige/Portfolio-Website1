        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> This is my portfolio of Projects for my Composing Digital Media Class</p>
        <p> I learned a lot from making this website.I had to learn how everything fit together as a beginner, from writing the HTML to using CSS to style the page. It was a little overwhelming at first, but as I became more accustomed to the pages' fundamental layout, I began to look forward to the process. I gained a lot of knowledge about how to arrange content and ensure that users will find the website easy to use.
            Making sure my website was simple to use and read was one thing I really needed to concentrate on. I took the time to ensure that the layout wasn't overly cluttered, the text was readable, and the images were easily accessible.</p>
        <p>It was a little challenging at first to figure out how to make everything look nice, but I eventually figured it out through trial and error. Additionally, I made sure that images had the appropriate alt text, which I now realize is crucial for accessibility. </p>
     <p> I've discovered that web design is more than just how things appear; it's also about making sure that everything is usable and intuitive. After reading about how these design decisions can impact how people feel and interact with the content, I gave careful consideration to how I used color and fonts on the website. It took some time to make sure everything was readable and aesthetically pleasing, but I believe it was worthwhile. </p>
     <p> In retrospect, I believe my writing and design skills have improved significantly. Writing well is only one aspect of web writing; another is considering how your audience will engage with the material. I learned from this project how crucial it is to take layout and design into account when presenting information. It helped me understand how design and writing combine to produce something more than just text.</p>
<p> Overall, I'm pleased with the website's appearance. It demonstrates my work and reflects the concepts I've learned in this course. As a novice, I'm pleased with my development and eager to keep honing my writing and web design abilities.</p>
